# Auto-GPT WebUI

This project is a frontend web application that runs and interacts with [Auto-GPT](https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT). The backend application provides the core logic and functionality, while this frontend application wraps over it and offers a user-friendly interface.

### üåü Special thanks to [the original Auto-GPT project](https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT) and its creator, [Torantulino](https://github.com/Torantulino), for his hard work and for making this project possible! üåü

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Usage

Clone the repo, then enter the root directory and run the folling commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run setup-auto_gpt
```

- The first command will install the required dependencies.
- The second command will clone the Auto-GPT repository and install its dependencies.

Run the following command in order to start both the frontend application and the Node.js server, which will in turn start and stop the python script, and inform the frontend of the script's output:

```bash
npm start
```

When you first open up the web app, you will see a few alerts about missing API Keys. You need to fill these in in order for the application to work correctly. Look below for instructions.
